This project implements a custom **8-bit RISC-style CPU** on the **DE1-SoC FPGA** using Verilog HDL, along with a supporting **C++ toolchain** that compiles and loads programs to the processor. The design is modular, extensible, and educational ,ideal for exploring CPU architecture, instruction execution, and FPGA deployment.
